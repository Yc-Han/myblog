Hi, it's Yichen.

More than half a year after my arrival at Germany and the beginning of my study at LMU, I created this website. 
I used to love writing (mostly in Chinese though). Until now, I found it hard for me to write down anything about my life, 
despite countless major changes. Nevertheless, I feel a push from within that says: you should write something, and I cannot resist it.

I was an active blogger for societal problems and language learning on a Chinese Quora-like platform called Zhihu until 2022 when I left my hometown. 
Unlike what I did there, this blog will be dedicated to more science-related topics, especially to statistics, data science and molecular biology, 
which are the focus of my study. Other posts about my daily life experiences may also occur from time to time.

For whatever reason you come to this site. I welcome you wholeheartedly and thank you for your attention.

The "Bild im Fokus" shows different ways of leveraging data. Most of us can extract information from it. 
My school trained me to connect pieces of information to form the "knowledge network". 
There have been moments when great insights pop up and thus I am able to do innovation. 
However, in this semester, our Institut provided with some very wordy, highly theoretical courses about the mathematical basics 
of the very practical statistics we learned in the last semester. I believe it is the "wisdom" illustrated here, 
the ability to follow a clear, convincing, and "wohldefinierte" path from prerequisites to conclusions. 
I complained about learning too much MaÃŸtheorie while the course should focus on Probabilities. 
Now I have changed my mind. A more detailed post about this will follow.

## Lists

Unordered

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    * Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
- Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

4. You can use sequential numbers...
5. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar

## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code

Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

```js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```
